An active class mechanism using Boost.Asio.

Active classes are those which methods are executed in its own thread. This 
kind of classes are useful to centralize some related tasks in a single 
thread. They are usually stimulated throught events or triggered operations - 
asynchronous operations.

This is an implementation on few lines of active class, using Boost.Asio. It
provides four macros: two for declaring methods, two for defining them.

Use ASYNC_METHOD macros for those methods that you want to execute them 
just in the class thread. If the class is not started, calls are queued and
they will be executed when started.

Use ASYNC_OR_SYNC_METHOD macros for those that you want to execute them
in the class thread if it is started, or in the caller thread if not.
